## Blackjack Project

### Week 5 Homework - Skill Distillery

#### Overview

This project provides an application in which Blackjack is played.


#### Concepts

- Object creation and manipulation - there are classes for Card, Deck, and Hand which can be of use outside of the current Blackjack project.
- Complex logic statements - the player is given different options depending on the current hand.

#### Technologies Used

- Java

#### Lessons Learned

- Visibility of fields
- Importance of refactoring/readability - the logic required for just the player has repetition with slight changes, so keeping the code "dry" allows for easier reading of the run() method within the app
